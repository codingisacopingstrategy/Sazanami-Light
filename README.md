Sazanami light
==============

I like the look of the Latin characters of Japanese Gothic fonts. ( Gothic is
an older term for sans-serif, the latter term is not used in Asian typography
because there are no serifs )

The letters look different because of the different stacking requirements
(vertical) in Japanese writing—the descenders are really short.

I decided to adapt the Open Source font Sazanami and make the Latin characters
suitable for use in graphic design with Western languages. More specifically,
for the visualisation component of the installation / performance HYPERMAP
which is part of Performance Studies International 17 taking part in Utrecht,
the Netherlands, May 25–29 2011.

We start from the original font sans the embedded bitmap fonts, and subsetted
to the Latin script. I used FontForge to do the subsetting and convert the
font to UFO sources. We might apply patches back to the original project. I
didn’t yet figure out the licence for Sazanami, but whatever it is we’ll do
this project under the same terms :)
